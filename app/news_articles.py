        'article': '<p>Neomedica’s website has primarily been static, things only change when changed by the webmasters. Recently, Neomedica has dipped its toes in a variable, user driven website. Being the first of its kind to do so, there is a large path to pave, but the prospect of an even more streamlined interface keeps the development running swiftly.</p><p>The new website backend, once released, promises an adaptive interface that changes depending on the user. For instance, if a patient is prone to a specific disease, they may see checkup indicators and the disease may pop up closer in search results. The redesign will effectively provide patients with more personalized healthcare and tailored information right at their fingertips. </p><p>According to recent insider news, the final implementation of this new AI can be expected in the next 2-3 years, with minor updates monthly.</p>',

        'article': '<p>At a recent virtual meet-and-greet with investors, much concern was expressed on the future of Neomedica, especially regarding the future of Neomedica’s founder and CEO, Sammy Urtzal.</p><p>Urtzal acknowledged the relatively long time she has spent as CEO, however, she urged investors not to worry, stating, “I do not foresee a CEO change in the Neomedica’s future.” Many investors were relieved. </p><p>Under Urtzal’s guidance, Neomedica has grown from a website run from a basement into one of the largest telehealth services with hundreds of thousands of patients. Expansion has been seen at unprecedented rates and there are no signs of slowing.</p><p>As for now, Urtzal has a firmly established position as CEO and investors don’t have to fear Neomedica losing Urtzal’s uniquely creative mind. </p>',

        'author': 'Mikey Carlson',
        'article': '<p>The Neomedica logo as we know it is going to be changed after September 30th, 2017. Following their recent spike in social media following, the marketing executives at Neolectra Inc. Have decided to make a slight alteration to their current logo.</p><p>While it’s not a dramatic change, the company hopes the switch will add to a modernized style within their branding and marketing. The new logo features a much larger, bolder font and cross. They hope to push for a more minimalist marketing strategy. Presumably, the company is trying to keep up with the modernization of the telehealth industry. </p><p>Paul Zhang, the company’s Chief Marketing Officer assures customers that the logo change doesn’t mean the company at its core is changing – “we’re still the same Neomedica that you know and love,” she said in a press conference. “We will continue to provide the best and boldest virtual medical treatment like usual, but this time with an equally bold logo”. </p><p>Fans of the company, however, have taken to Twitter to express their opinions on the change.</p><img class = "newImage" src = "/static/images/Tweet.png">',

As Neomedica’s long standing CFO, there is little beyond the mind of Santos. </p> <p>His high level of math knowledge did not stop him from going back to the basics, though, as he was seen tutoring 2nd graders on their multiplication tables at George Washington Elementary School on Monday. When interviewed about his gracious volunteerism, Santos had the following to say: </p><p>“Yeah, you know I do love seeing the learning on their little faces – it reminds me of myself at a young age. Volunteering is a great way to stay in touch with the youth.” </p><p>Truly remarkable; Neomedica employees and executives are truly the most kind-hearted people. </p>',
