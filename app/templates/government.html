Immediately, several companies began intensive research into a potential vaccine; Neomedica became one of them. Out of all the companies, we were the most transparent, providing status updates and sharing all of our findings with the CDC. As a result, weâ€™ve developed a strong partnership with the CDC, and we offer free CDC scientists free Neomedica care at any time. </p>
