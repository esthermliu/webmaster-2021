                                <p>Shelby Cortez is medically trained, U.S. board certified, licensed and credentialed in her field. As a young child, Cortez always knew she wanted to dabble in either the medical or computer field, but was unsure as to which one she would ultimately pick. After learning about Neomedica, Cortez immediately knew that this was her destiny, her future. Ambitious and driven, Cortez graduated with flying colors, obtaining various high-level degrees in computer science and medicine. Today, she says that her job at Neomedica fulfills her beyond anything else in her life, and her patients clearly notice this passion as they praise her for being a "fervently devoted and passionate" doctor. As for her interest in computer science, Cortez still deals with computers every day, and in her free time even helps develop backend features for Neomedica. Bravo, Cortez!</p>

                                <p> Maisie Edweena was not your typical studious medical student in college. In fact, she was quite the opposite. Rambunctious and loud by nature, Edweena struggled to stay focused during school and would often receive poor grades. However, after learning about Neomedica and its mission, Edweena was determined to help and become a part of such a significant movement. Immediately, her grades soared through the roof and so did her passion for medicine. Today, Edweena is praised as one of the most "compassionate, energetic, lively, and optimistic" physicians in the world. Even if she may not necessarily be able to accurately diagnose her patients, they remark that "her kindness is truly one of a kind. And that is enough for us."</p>

"Learning about Neomedica was truly a game-changer for me," Nthanda says, as he fondly reminisces about his university days. "Telemedicine is the future. It's that simple."   </p>

                                <p> Dixon Totty graduated top of his class from Stanford University and continues to be one of the top employees here at Neomedica. Incredibly intelligent, he always knows exactly what is wrong with his patients. He developts and manages treatment plans with such finesse and skill that patients can merely remark in pure awe, "Wow." Outside of work, Totty is also known for being a family man and often takes his family out on extensive (and expensive!) trips around the world, posting their adventures on social media along the way. If your physician assistant is Dixon Totty, you definitely don't have to worry about any awkward silence during your meetings! There's always more to discuss with a man who has seen the world. </p>

                                <p> Alhaji Chiemeka is known for her calming presence and willingless to listen, regardless of the situation. Her patients call her a "calming spirit, the kindest one you'll ever meet." Even in a world full of distractions, Chiemeka manages to keep everything under control and has never been known to shout or yell in her life. Close friends and family members note that they have never heard her voice go above "60 decibels," and they are currently unsure as to whether her voice "can even achieve such panicked volumes." It seems that nothing can agitate Chiemeka, and as her patients fondly report, she is a "steadfast rock in a world of chaos."</p>

From his heart to his kind gaze to even his touch, everything about him is soft, and patients love him for it. "He's so kind and sweet and just an amazing therapist!" declares one satisfied patient. Katsuhito has never been known to give a nasty glare at anyone in his life, and people always report that he is the "best and most compassionate listener" they have ever met in their lives. </p>
