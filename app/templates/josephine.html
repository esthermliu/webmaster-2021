None of this changed as she became a pre-teen and eventually an adolescent. She had a knack for painting and drawing, and to this day Jo auctions her artwork at high-profile galleries. One of her most vivid memories from her teenage years was when her father asked her what she wanted to do in life; panicking, she blurted out the first thing that came to mind: “I’ll help run a company!” From that point, she had a prophecy to fulfill.  </p>

During college, she had two goals – to take care of herself and to focus on her schoolwork. Although balancing these objectives was what she called a “juggling act”, she stayed true to her target and developed excellent self-care methods. She would later apply her principle of finding balance to Neomedica, where she pitched in ideas for their world-class anxiety therapy.  </p>

She immediately contacted Sammy Urtzal and killed her interview. Today, Greenberg continues to help find balance for Neomedica, even in the strangest, most surreal times.</p>
